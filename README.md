**Mobility** -> Mobil + ity  
_tripartite motto_ (ity) : Quality, Flexibility, Utility

**Quality**: assuring the authority of data provided  
**Flexibility**: easily accommodate the user choices and preferences  
**Utility**: the application do not only inform the user but also tries to help the user/student making a decision  

Italy -> **It** + al + **y**  
Bologna, a Italian city but also a process that actually helped boosting European Mobility exchange flows

Portugal -> Portug + **al**
